# World Betting Assessment

The proiejct is the solution for world betting assessment .

## Note 
The project and solution is not fully function due to the following (This are not ecxcused but issue which I needed sometime to sort them ):
 - The main problem I have personal laptop which is home window OS version ( Only I can used Docker for Lunix for windows not able to run properly)
 - The MySQL image also not able to work so that I can't connect MySQL workbench .
 - .Net 8 haven't used it as mostlhy was still on .Net 5 (so had to get some undestadiong of how the framework works first with little time ).
 
It's fair that I be excluded on this application
